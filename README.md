and the **Lua extention** (`ext install sumneko.lua`)

Then in your workspace, if the extention doesn't dectect your mod, open the command palette (ctrl + shift + p) and enter `activate forts API` this will activate the completion and intellisense.
For the doc if your not working in `/Steam/steamapps/common/Forts/data/mods/` (or in `/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/410900/`) put AT THE VERY TOP of your file (line 1) `--- forts API ---` like that :
```lua
--- forts API ---

<your code>
```
